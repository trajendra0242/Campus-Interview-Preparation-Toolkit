It aids in code reusability and helps the developer to maintain applications without redundant code. The class inheriting from another class is a child class or also called a derived class. The class from which a child class derives the members are called parent class or superclass.
21,Are access specifiers used in python?,"Python does not make use of access specifiers specifically like private, public, protected, etc. However, it does not deprive this to any variables. It has the concept of imitating the behaviour of variables by making use of a single (protected) or double underscore (private) as prefixed to the variable names. By default, the variables without prefixed underscores are public."
22,Is it possible to call parent class without its instance creation?,"Yes, it is possible if the base class is instantiated by other child classes or if the base class is a static method."
23,How is an empty class created in python?,An empty class does not have any members defined in it. It is created by using the pass keyword (the pass command does nothing in python). We can create objects for this class outside the clas
24,Differentiate between new and override modifiers.,The new modifier is used to instruct the compiler to use the new implementation and not the base class function. The Override modifier is useful for overriding a base class function inside the child class.
25,How will you check if a class is a child of another class?,This is done by using a method called issubclass() provided by python. The method tells us if any class is a child of another class by returning true or false accordingly.

58, What is a Dequeue?,"t is a double-ended queue, or a data structure, where the elements can be inserted or deleted at both ends (FRONT and REAR)"
59,What are the advantages of the heap over a stack?,Heap is more flexible than the stack because memory space can be dynamically allocated and de-allocated as needed
60,How to convert stack into queue,"To enqueue an item into the queue, first move all elements from the first stack to the second stack, push the item into the first stack, and finally move all elements back to the first stack. This ensures that the new item lies at the bottom of the stack and hence would be the last one to be removed."

138,"What are proxy servers, and how do they protect computer networks?","Proxy servers primarily prevent external users who are identifying the IP addresses of an internal network. Without knowledge of the correct IP address, even the physical location of the network cannot be identified. Proxy servers can make a network virtually invisible to external users"
139,What is the function of the OSI Session Layer?,"This layer provides the protocols and means for two devices on the network to communicate with each other by holding a session. This includes setting up the session, managing information exchange during the session, and tear-down process upon termination of the session."
140,What is a private IP address?,"Private IP addresses are assigned for use on intranets. These addresses are used for internal networks and are not routable on external public networks. These ensure that no conflicts are present among internal networks. At the same time, the same range of private IP addresses is reusable for multiple intranets since they do not “see”"
141,What is DoS?,"DoS, or Denial-of-Service attack, is an attempt to prevent users from being able to access the Internet or any other network services. Such attacks may come in different forms and are done by a group of perpetrators. One common method of doing this is to overload the system server so it cannot anymore process legitimate traffic and will be forced to reset"
142,"What is OSI, and what role does it play in computer networks?","OSI (Open Systems Interconnect) serves as a reference model for data communication. It is made up of 7 layers, with each layer defining a particular aspect of how network devices connect and communicate with one another. One layer may deal with the physical media used, while another layer dictates how data is transmitted across the network."
143,What is the purpose of cables being shielded and having twisted pairs?,The primary purpose of this is to prevent crosstalk. Crosstalk’s are electromagnetic interferences or noise that can affect data being transmitted across cables
144,What are MAC addresses?,"MAC, or Media Access Control, uniquely identifies a device on the network. It is also known as a physical address or an Ethernet address. A MAC address is made up of 6-byte parts."
145,What is the equivalent layer or layers of the TCP/IP Application layer in terms of the OSI reference model?,"The TCP/IP Application layer has three counterparts on the OSI model: 1) Session Layer, 2) Presentation Layer, and 3) Application Layer"
146,What are firewalls?,Firewalls serve to protect an internal network from external attacks. These external threats can be hackers who want to steal data or computer viruses that can wipe out data in an instant. It also prevents other users from external networks from gaining access to the private network
147,What are gateways?,Gateways provide connectivity between two or more network segments. It is usually a computer that runs the gateway software and provides translation services. This translation is key in allowing different systems to communicate on the network.
148,What is the disadvantage of a star topology?,"One major disadvantage of star topology is that once the central Hub or switch gets damaged, the entire network becomes unusable."
149,What is DHCP?,"DHCP is short for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. Its main task is to assign an IP address to devices across the network automatically. It first checks for the next available address not yet taken by any device, then assigns this to a network device."
150,What is the use of a default gateway?,Default gateways provide means for the local networks to connect to the external network. The default gateway for connecting to the external network is usually the address of the external router port.
